i use .vbl for the file extension but its not really needed
to run it make sure the interpter is in the same location and run 'python3 vbl.py file.vbl" and replace file.vbl with the program you wanna run

tips:
you can use pint anywhere in the program to reset all registers and the buffer

Calculator example (might not work due to big updates to vblang):"
pint
prt "0. addition"
prt "1. subtraction"
uib
isb 13
prt "sub enter first number"
uib
prt "enter second number"
uic
sub
cba
prt "the answer is:"
dbf
jmp 22
prt "add enter first number"
uib
prt "enter second number"
uic
add
cba
prt "the answer is:"
dbf
prt "end"
"

commands:
pint - initializes program does not accept arguments
dmp - display contents of all registers and bffr
cbf - clear bffr
cba - copy rega to bffr
crb - copy regb to bffr
ccb - copy regc to bffr
cbd - copy bffr to regd
cbe - copy bffr to rege
dbf - display contents of buffer to screen
rcs - sets value to regc - example:"rcs 5"
rbs - sets value to regb - example:"rbs 5"
ose - execute shell command - example:"whoami"

icm - compares regb and regc and jumps to line if equal - example:"icm 5" jumps to line 5 if regb and regc are the same int value
scm - compares regd and rege and jumps to line if equal - example:"icm 5" jumps to line 5 if regd and regd are the same str value
ibm - compares regb to int and jumps to line if equal - example:"ibm 5 20" jumps to line 20 if regb is 5
icm - compares regc to int and jumps to line if equal - example:"icm 5 20" jumps to line 20 if regc is 5
idm - compares regd to string and jumps to line if equal - example:"idm yes 20" jumps to line 20 if regd is yes
iem - compares rege to string and jumps to line if equal - example:"iem yes 20" jumps to line 20 if rege is yes

jmp - jumps to a specified line in the program - example:"jmp 20"

dlf - deletes a specified file - example:"dlf file.txt"

ctd - copy text from bffr to regd
cte - copy text from bffr to rege
rtd - sets text to regd from string - example:"rtd test" sets regd to test
rte - sets text to rege from string - example:"rte test" sets rege to test
stb - sets text to bffr from string - example:"stb test" sets bffr to test
ltd - loads text from file to regd - example:"ltd file.txt" sets regd to the contents of file.txt
lte - loads text from file to rege - example:"lte file.txt" sets rege to the contents of file.txt
srb - saves int from regb to file - example:"srb file.txt" sets file.txt to the contents of regb
sra - saves int from rega to file - example:"sra file.txt" sets file.txt to the contents of rega
src - saves int from regc to file - example:"src file.txt" sets file.txt to the contents of regc
uib - get int user input into regb does not accept arguments
uic - get int user input into regc does not accept arguments
uid - get string user input into regd does not accept arguments
uie - get string user input into rege does not accept arguments

isw - swaps the contents of regb and regc
ssw - swaps the contents of regd and rege
add - adds the contents of regb and regc into rega
sub - subtracts the contents of regb from regc into rega
mul - multiplies the contents of regb and regc into rega
div - divides the contents of regb by regc into rega
inc - increments the value of regb by 1
dec - decrements the value of regb by 1

isa - checks if rega is equal to 0 if so jump to line - example:"isa 20" jumps to line 20 if rega is 0
isb - checks if regb is equal to 0 if so jump to line - example:"isb 20" jumps to line 20 if regb is 0
isc - checks if regc is equal to 0 if so jump to line - example:"isc 20" jumps to line 20 if regc is 0
