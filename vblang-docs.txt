i dont really know how this language works, you can find some example programs tips and a list of commands below
i use .vbl for the file extension but its not really needed
to run it make sure the interpter is in the same location and run 'python3 vbl.py file.vbl" and replace file.vbl with the script you wanna run

tips:
you can use pint anywhere in the program to reset all registers and the buffer


Calculator:"
pint
prt "0. addition"
prt "1. subtraction"
uib
isb 13
prt "sub enter first number"
uib
prt "enter second number"
uic
sub
cba
prt "the answer is:"
dbf
jmp 22
prt "add enter first number"
uib
prt "enter second number"
uic
add
cba
prt "the answer is:"
dbf
prt "end"
"

Debug features:
dmp - print the data of all registers and the buffer


pint - initializes
cbf - clear bffr
cba - copy rega to bffr
crb - copy regb to bffr
ccb - copy regc to bffr
cbd - copy bffr to regd
cbe - copy bffr to rege
dbf - display contents of buffer to screen
rcs - sets value to regc
rbs - sets value to regb
ose - execute shell command, e.g ls

icm - compares regb and regc and jumps to line if equal
scm - compares regd and rege and jumps to line if equal
ibm - compares regb to int and jumps to line if equal
icm - compares regc to int and jumps to line if equal
idm - compares regd to string and jumps to line if equal
iem - compares rege to string and jumps to line if equal

jmp - jumps to a specified line in the program

dlf - deletes a specified file

ctd - copy text from bffr to regd
cte - copy text from bffr to rege
rtd - sets text to regd from string
rte - sets text to rege from string
stb - sets text to bffr from string
ltd - loads text from file to regd
lte - loads text from file to rege
srb - saves int from regb to file
sra - saves int from rega to file
src - saves int from regc to file
uib - get int user input into regb
uic - get int user input into regc
uid - get string user input into regd
uie - get string user input into rege

isw - swaps the contents of regb and regc
ssw - swaps the contents of regd and rege
add - adds the contents of regb and regc into rega
sub - subtracts the contents of regb from regc into rega
mul - multiplies the contents of regb and regc into rega
div - divides the contents of regb by regc into rega
inc - increments the value of regb by 1
dec - decrements the value of regb by 1

isa - checks if rega is equal to 0 if so jump to line
isb - checks if regb is equal to 0 if so jump to line
isc - checks if regc is equal to 0 if so jump to line
